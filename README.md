Columbia Module 3 Challenge: JavaScript

## Description
In this week's Challenge, I created a web app, using JavaScript, that allows users to generate a random password. Random passwords can be helpful, as they are harder to hack! You should not include personal data in your passwords, so this random password generator solves the real-world issue of creating passwords that make it difficult to hack. This Challenge allowed me to apply the JavaScript code I learned about in Module 3, including event listeners, for loops, and logging to the console.

## Usage
To use this deployed application, click the "Generate Password" button. The page will instruct you to enter a number to indicate how many characters you wish to include in your password. Note that this value must be a number (no letters or special characters), and that it must be a number between 8 and 128. Otherwise, an alert will show that says "Invalid entry." Once you have chosen your password's length and clicked "OK," you will be asked four questions about whether you would like your password to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. To use a specific type of character in your password, click "OK"; if you do not wish to include a character type in your password, click "Cancel." Once you have completed the character-type questions, a password that meets your inputted password criteria will appear on the page! Just copy and paste it into the desired location to use it! **Note:** You may want to securely store the generated password somewhere for safekeeping and for easy referencing in the future!

See the image below for a password generated using my web application that specifies a password length of 100 characters containing only uppercase, numeric, and special characters:
